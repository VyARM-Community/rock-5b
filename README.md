This repository provides an unofficial VyOS image for the Radxa ROCK 5B by combining:

- the VyOS ARM64 userspace and configuration system;
- a board-adapted VyOS kernel, modules and firmware, with EDK II UEFI firmware and the VyOS EFI/GRUB boot path;
- first-boot networking helpers and additional network, Wi-Fi and cellular modem drivers and firmware.

**Upstream attribution:** VyOS provides the routing userspace and configuration framework; Armbian provides board integration references; the edk2-rk3588 project provides UEFI firmware; Radxa designs and documents the ROCK 5B hardware.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an independent community project built from components provided by **VyOS**, **Armbian**, and **Radxa** ecosystems. It is not produced, supported, sponsored, certified, or endorsed by the VyOS project, Sentrium S.L., Armbian, Armbian d.o.o., Radxa, or Radxa Computer Co., Ltd. Rolling releases may contain regressions and should be tested before production use.

## Quick Start

### 1. Download the ready-to-use image

Open the [Releases page](https://github.com/VyARM-Community/rock-5b/releases) and download:

```text
vyos-VERSION-rock-5b-network.img.xz
vyos-VERSION-rock-5b-network.img.xz.sha256
```

Verify the download on Linux:

```bash
sha256sum -c vyos-VERSION-rock-5b-network.img.xz.sha256
```

Use a target drive larger than the uncompressed image and a boot medium supported by the ROCK 5B. Replace `VERSION` in all examples with the version from the selected release.

### 2. Flash with balenaEtcher

[balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

1. Start balenaEtcher.
2. Select `vyos-VERSION-rock-5b-network.img.xz` directly.
3. Select the target boot medium.
4. Click **Flash**.
5. Wait for flashing and verification to finish.

> [!CAUTION]
> Flashing destroys all data on the selected target drive. Verify the destination carefully.

### 3. Flash from Linux with `dd`

Replace `/dev/sdX` with the complete target device, not a partition such as `/dev/sdX1`.

#### Option A: write the compressed image directly

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdX?* 2>/dev/null || true
xz -dc vyos-VERSION-rock-5b-network.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
sync
sudo eject /dev/sdX
```

#### Option B: extract first, then write

This may be faster on slower systems because decompression and writing do not occur simultaneously.

```bash
xz -dk vyos-VERSION-rock-5b-network.img.xz
sudo umount /dev/sdX?* 2>/dev/null || true
sudo dd if=vyos-VERSION-rock-5b-network.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
sync
sudo eject /dev/sdX
```

---

## First Boot and Login

1. Connect the ROCK 5B Ethernet port to a network that provides DHCP.
2. Insert or attach the flashed boot drive.
3. Power on the ROCK 5B.
4. Allow approximately 60–90 seconds for first-boot configuration.
5. Find the assigned address in your router or DHCP server.
6. Connect over SSH.

Default credentials for this image:

```text
Username: vyos
Password: vyos
```

Example:

```bash
ssh vyos@192.168.1.100
```

Replace the example address with the address assigned to your ROCK 5B.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Change the default password immediately after the first login. For stronger security, configure SSH key authentication and stop using password-based login.

Change the password:

```text
configure
set system login user vyos authentication plaintext-password 'YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD'
commit
save
exit
```

Check Ethernet locally from the HDMI or serial console:

```bash
ip -4 -br addr show eth0
```

<details>
<summary><strong>First-boot diagnostics</strong></summary>

```bash
cat /config/dhcp-wan-firstboot-wrapper.log
cat /config/dhcp-wan-ssh-setup.log
systemctl status dhclient@eth0.service --no-pager -l
```

The first-boot marker is:

```text
/config/.dhcp-wan-ssh-firstboot-done
```

</details>

## Optional Helper Scripts

The image includes helper scripts under `/usr/local/share/vyos-arm64-firstboot/`, with convenience links in `/home/vyos`. Start from the `vyos` account and use the command shown for each helper below.

### Configure locale, time and regional settings

Run this helper as the `vyos` user, without `sudo`:

```bash
/home/vyos/set-locales.sh
```

It guides you through the time zone, console keyboard layout, wireless regulatory country, DNS servers and NTP servers. It also persists the system locale as `C.UTF-8`, restarts Chrony and checks time synchronization. Review the proposed settings before applying them. Committing wireless settings may briefly restart an active access point.

### Configure a wireless access point

Run this helper as the `vyos` user, **without `sudo`**. The script invokes `sudo` internally where required.

```bash
/home/vyos/ap-dhcp-wan-setup.sh
```

This is separate from the automatic wired DHCP and SSH setup. Run it only when an access point, DHCP server, DNS forwarding, and NAT are required.

### Configure a modem

Run this helper from the `vyos` account **with `sudo`**. Unlike the AP and locale helpers, the modem setup script explicitly requires root privileges.

```bash
sudo /home/vyos/modem-connect.sh
```

Modem support depends on the modem, transport, drivers, firmware, carrier, and APN.

## Supported Hardware

Peripheral results below are project-level references, not confirmation that every listed device has been tested on this exact ROCK 5B image. Consult the release notes for board-specific validation.

### Wi-Fi adapters

`ap-dhcp-wan-setup.sh` does not hard-code a specific chipset. It enumerates every `phy` under `/sys/class/ieee80211`, reads supported interface modes from the kernel with `iw phy <phy> info`, and only offers devices that report AP mode support.

#### Hardware reported working with the project

- MediaTek MT7921-class M.2/PCIe Wi-Fi 6 adapters
- Realtek RTL8852-class M.2/PCIe Wi-Fi 6 adapters
- MediaTek MT7612U-based USB adapters

#### Expected to work

- Other Linux `mac80211` adapters that advertise AP mode

Adapters whose drivers only support client or station mode cannot be used by the AP helper.

Useful diagnostics:

```bash
ip link show
iw dev
dmesg
```

### Cellular modems

`modem-connect.sh` supports PCIe- and USB-attached modems, preferring native VyOS WWAN configuration where supported and using helpers for device-specific initialization and the AT/RNDIS fallback path.

#### Tested with the project

- Fibocom FM350-GL (Revision: 81600.0000.00.29.24.02,  SVN: 10), including automatic FCC unlock over the AT port

#### Expected to work with compatible drivers and firmware

- Quectel RM505Q
- Intel XMM7560-based modems
- Other QMI- or MBIM-capable modems supported by ModemManager

Actual connectivity also depends on the SIM carrier, APN, regional firmware, and supported bands.

## Updates

### Update through the board channel

**On a fresh installation, the ROCK 5B update channel is configured automatically during first-boot setup.** You do not need to enter an update URL. No automatic image installation is enabled.

To install the latest image, run this command in operational mode:

```text
add system image latest
```

Follow the installer prompts, retain your configuration and previous image, then reboot when ready as described below.

The channel becomes usable when the first release containing `image-version.json` has been published. This feed points to the matching ROCK 5B ISO with additional network support.

### Update using a specific ISO

Alternatively, copy the full HTTPS download link of the desired `.iso` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/VyARM-Community/rock-5b/releases):

```text
add system image https://github.com/VyARM-Community/rock-5b/releases/download/RELEASE_TAG/vyos-VERSION-rock-5b-network.iso
```

Replace `RELEASE_TAG` and `VERSION` with the actual release values. Use the `.iso` for system-image updates; `.img.xz` is intended for initial installation or recovery.

### Configuration, reboot and rollback

1. Save your current configuration with `configure`, `save`, then `exit`, and keep a separate backup of `/config/config.boot`.
2. Run one of the installation commands above and follow its prompts. Choose to retain the current configuration when requested.
3. Keep the previous working image as a fallback. Use `show system image` to inspect the installed images and boot selection.
4. Reboot when ready with `reboot`.
5. Check networking and the configured services after boot.

To select a retained image for the next boot, use its exact name from `show system image`:

```text
set system image default-boot IMAGE_NAME
reboot
```

These are operational-mode commands. The ROCK 5B image uses EDK II UEFI firmware and the native VyOS EFI/GRUB system-image boot path.

## Releases

Prebuilt images are published on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/VyARM-Community/rock-5b/releases).

Each release should normally contain:

```text
vyos-VERSION-rock-5b-network.img.xz
vyos-VERSION-rock-5b-network.img.xz.sha256
```

Use the compressed `.img.xz` for initial installation. A matching `.iso` and `.iso.sha256` are provided for supported system-image updates.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the changes in each release.

The published VyOS Rolling is a reference; package versions may differ because the image is built later against the rolling package repository.
